      <h4 class="studentNum">Student number: s3872832</h4>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">I’m a 23-year-old Tax Preparer born and raised in Perth. I work full time in an accounting firm
        and have been for the past 5 years. My interest in IT was fostered at a very young age, I recall my dad teaching
        me the basics of computing around the age of nine and it snowballed from there. I remember building programs in
        visual basics as well as being the IT monitor in middle school due to my adept knowledge for my age. My hobbies include
        weightlifting, gaming and Squash.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">The abrupt changes the world has taken in the past few months have encouraged me to return to studies
        to invest my time and knowledge into an industry that is both increasing in relevance as well as is very flexible in the sense
        that it can be either in house or fully abroad with little to no change in operation.</p>

      <h4 class="studentNum">Student number: s3378980</h4>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">I’m a 26-year-old audio technician based in Melbourne. Being a full-time employee for Australia’s largest
        concert audio provider, I’ve worked on stages such as Falls Festival, Download Festival and Splendour in the
        Grass as well as arena tours with the likes of Hilltop Hoods and Bring Me the Horizon.
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">I grew an interest in IT as a kid while playing video games and discovering the internet on the family computer and later learning
        to program homebrew for the Sony PSP handheld. Hobbies I have picked up over the years include playing music
        and 3D printing. </p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">The recent closure of the music industry has led me to pursue further education in IT as a
        second career path. With existing skills in the JavaScript and Python programming languages, as well as
        network architecture from working with audio networking systems, I hope to develop further knowledge of
        server-side technologies and web application deployment.</p>

      <h3 class="name">Zorren Miller</h3>
      <h4 class="studentNum">Student number: s3874332</h4>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">I’m 31, live in Falls Creek, Victoria. I am a chef by trade; only cook in the winter season unless for special occasions or for the local pizza oven we have every
        Friday in summer unless we decide to go somewhere else. For the last few summers, I have been working as a laborer and shuttling the mountain bike riders up to the summit in Falls
        Creek. I also do this at Mt Buller, Beachworth, Bright, and Mt Beauty. Last year I started laying fiber optics in the village, where we put fiber into the building not just to the
        node like Telstra.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">I like to keep busy, so I have few things on the cards. For fun I take my motorbike out and about the valleys or go exploring with my ute.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">I first got introduced into html and graphics when I was 11 at the local library. I played around for a while but got into other things. While the world is ever
        getting more technology based, along the pandemic that has struck the world, I thought it was a great time to get back into IT as I have a bit more time as I have started my own business last year.</p>

      <h4 class="studentNum">Student number: s3871390</h4>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">I’m 21 years old, born in the Southern Highlands, south of Sydney. I am currently working as a Signals Officer
        in the Australian Army, having been in for around 4 years.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">My interest in IT began when I was young, like many others it was fostered through video games. I took several
        IT related subjects in school, gaining a wide array of knowledge in the field of IT, however not specialising in any field. My current
        role has developed knowledge of communication mediums, primarily through radio frequency means, with a focus on telecommunications
        installations and equipment.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">My hobbies include gaming, weight training and AFL.</p>

      <h3 class="name">Timothy Bridges</h3>
      <h4 class="studentNum">Student number: s3650170</h4>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">23, live in Emerald, Vic. I currently work in gardening and landscaping, but that is not my intended career path
        in the future. I do this work to make money, but my interests primarily lie in building and maintaining online
        communities, and video game design.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo"> I have six years of experience in leading and moderating online communities
        for developers/publishers Double Fine Productions, Warner Bros Games and IO Interactive. I am most deeply involved
        currently with IO Interactive, working with them regularly to foster a growing fanbase for the Hitman game series.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">
        A further fledgling interest I have is in QA, but I am in the process of learning more about it and have not had much
        experience in the industry yet. Most of my experience in QA is informal, where I have pushed games to their systematic
        limit and tried to break them for fun. I have done some casual testing for the game Full Throttle Remastered and
        have been involved in testing for other smaller games as well.</p>

      <h4 class="studentNum">Student number: s3858026</h4>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">I am 27 years old. I was born and raised in Tasmania, Australia. I relocated to Sydney in 2018 before moving
        to Melbourne in 2019 to be closer to family. I am from an Australian background, with many generations of my family
        having been born and raised in Australia. I completed a Bachelor of Nursing in 2013 at the University of Tasmania
        and worked as a nurse until June of this year.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo"> I love to read, cook, game, craft, and travel.
        My favourite place I have travelled to so far is Hawaii, I loved learning about the history and culture.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo"> I have very limited
        IT experience; however, my interest was sparked when I began online courses to teach myself HTML and CSS earlier
        this year which encouraged me to pursue further education and new job opportunities.</p>

    <h2 class="containerSubHeadings">Group processes</h2>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Our effectiveness in assignment 2 was quite good; however, there were some notable improvements needed. Our communication efficiency
      wasn’t that strong and our collaboration suffered because of it. There would be times where we were very quick to assist any of our group members' queries;
      however, there were also periods when there would be little to no communication and it was difficult to not double up on content being written as well as
      queries not being answered. A major change we hope to employ during assignment 3 is our communication skills. Something as simple as ensuring we are all
      timely for group meetings and quick to respond to group members queries will go a long way towards easing the stress of putting the assignment on pause
      because we’re not sure who has attempted what section yet and if anyone is falling behind in their share of the workload.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Another change we will introduce is solid timeframes, as simple as it sounds it was not something that we strictly followed in assignment 2.
      Things as simple as setting deadlines for certain sections of the assignment would allow us to assess whether anyone is getting stuck on a certain section or even
      if someone is not managing their time properly. It will also allow us to improve the standard of our work by tackling questions in an open-minded manner as opposed
      to cramming content and feeling rushed. Rushing the work leaves room for errors and doesn’t allow the group-member to fully apply all their knowledge to the question
      at hand.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Proofreading was also an important factor for us and it's not that we necessarily didn’t do enough in assignment 2 but there Is always room
      for improvement. With large assignments such as assignment 2 and 3 it takes a while to proofread all of the content so, instead, we will incrementally proofread
      our assignment in blocks after each section is completed as opposed to proofreading the entire assignment when it is finalised. This both simplifies the proofreading
      process as well as improves its effectiveness.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">All-in-all, our group worked well together in assignment 2; however, these few changes can make all the difference between us working well
      and us actually working well together to produce a top-tier assignment. Communication is very important and either makes or breaks a group assignment so I think once
      we’ve mastered our communication skills and deadline enforcement, we’ll be a very proficient team.</p>

  <div class ="maxWidthContainer" id="teamProfileBox">
    <h2 class="containerSubHeadings">career plans</h2>
    <p class="techReportInfo">The groups career plans are very similar in respect to the direction they intend to take yet differ greatly when it comes to their ideal job.
      Every member in the group aims to progress through RMIT University and achieve a wealth of knowledge by doing so in order to set themselves up for a promising career
      in the IT sector. Following this, and in some cases during this, they intend to seek external supplementary education in the form of either an internship in their preferred
      career path or as a paid employee. This is where the similarities end though, only Zorren and Lachlan intend to take similar career paths specifically in the Software
      Engineering sector. Common elements their career paths hold are things such as team building, software proficiency, personal growth in a career as well as learning to
      work in a highly competitive environment.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Luke’s career path and plan takes a different approach, with the intent to become a Strategic and International Policy officer. Rather than
      scouting for an internship, he will enroll in government-based trainee programs that will coincide with his university studies. Despite this his initial growth and
      knowledge base will still be RMIT among other external readings. Like both Zorren and Lachlan, Luke’s career plan has not changed between assignment 1 and now;
      maintaining his passion and drive for a career in Strategic International Policies.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Michelle’s plan to pursue a career in web development has not waivered either, in fact, so much so that she is still set on pursuing Frontend
      Web Development specifically. If anything, her drive for this career in particular has only strengthened. Much like Michelle, Timothy’s career plan has not changed either.
      He is set on excelling as a Quality Assurance Specialist, specifically in the gaming sector. This is quite fitting as his attitude towards our assessments was meticulous.
      He was sure to speak out to ensure everyone was up to speed during meetings and general communications as well as reaching out privately to ensure everyone was doing well
      and nothing was stunting their progress. Jorin’s preference was in a similar sector to Timothy’s, they both plan to pursue careers in the gaming sector however Jorin plans
      to specialize as a Senior Developer. His passion for this career was evident from the beginning much like the other group members so it came to no surprise that when asked
      the question of whether he would change his career decision he was quick to say no.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Everything considered, none of our group members decided to change their career plans in response to their feedback from assignment 1 or 2 so it's
      difficult to discuss if there were common elements between their old career plan and thus their lack thereof a new career plan. However, if we were to analyze the common
      elements between all of our career plans it would be that time management, group cohesion and punctuality are all major factors that we share. Additionally, the ability to
      work in a high stress environment as well as having the ambition to continue the learning process as our career plans progress are also factors our careers would share,
      interestingly enough, these are also all factors that needed to be employed in producing our group assignments in order to achieve success. Assessing the similarities and
      differences of said careers, it would be true to say that all specialized industries actually collide, for instance Zorren and Lachlan's choice of Software Engineering in
      many instances is tightly integrated with Michelle’s career choice of Frontend Web Development. A use case would be in an instance where software is being developed by the
      engineers and Michelle would have to work closely with them in order to assess themes and content that the software contains that would be ideal for marketing and displaying
      on the web side of the business. Even more so if the software happened to be game related then both Jorin and Timothy’s career paths would also be involved in the process so
      it's quite evident that these careers integrate frequently. Luke’s career plan however is a specialty profession where it is intentionally not harmonious with other similar
      IT careers due to the fact that sensitive national data is the underlying nature of the career.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Our career plans nonetheless are almost identical where we intend to pursue university level studies in conjunction with either an internship or paid
      job placement at a relevant firm and grow both our knowledge and career progress throughout said employment.</p>
