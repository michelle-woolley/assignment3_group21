    <h2 class="containerSubHeadings">overview</h2>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Topic</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Feline Friendly is a web-based service with a companion mobile app for Android that aims to provide information and education to cat owners
      regarding items which are toxic to cats. Feline Friendly will enable users to identify and access information on a variety of foods, plants, household products,
      and medications. The user will be provided with evidence-based information on whether they are dangerous to cats and what they should do if they believe their cat
      has come into contact with the toxin. The service will allow users to find details of veterinary clinics within their area and contact details of pet poison hotlines
      they can contact in the event they believe their cat has been poisoned.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"> As an outcome of this project, cat owners would have an educational resource readily available to them which contains all the information
      necessary for them to identify and react to a poisoning event; without having to access multiple different resources to get the information they require. We hope the
      creation of this project will assist in reducing the likelihood of cat poisonings occurring and prevent deaths with the inclusion of veterinary and hotline contact details.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Motivation</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">As discussed by DeClementi (2014), one of the best ways to prevent pet poisoning is through the provision of poison prevention information.
      Currently, there are very few resources available to cat owners that include information on toxins, what to do if their cat is poisoned, and where they can go for help.
      Feline Friendly wants to provide cat owners with a comprehensive resource they can refer to for all the information they need regarding toxins, enabling them to recognise and respond quickly to poisoning events. Through the use of plant
      identification technology, the current trends of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning will be incorporated into this project for users to be able to identify unknown plants their cat has consumed through photography. Working on this
      project will show our ability to remotely collaborate on a project; capability to learn and apply unfamiliar IT technologies quickly; and ability to take a project from an idea through
      to design and prototyping.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Landscape</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">There are similar services currently available, such as the Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) website and mobile application; created by American
      Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) (2014). APCC provides detailed information to users which covers plants, medications, foods, and household hazards;
      however, it is an American based service and the poison hotline numbers it provides are relevant for American residents only. ‘Plants for Cats’, created by Delattre
      Consulting (2020) is another alternate mobile application currently available through the Google Play store. ‘Plants for Cats’ provides poison hotline numbers for multiple
      countries; however, its content is limited to just plant information. Feline Friendly will bridge the gap between existing products by creating a service that provides
      all of these features within one product.</p>
    <h2 class="containerSubHeadings">description</h2>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Aims</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">For Feline Friendly, our aim is to create a semi-functional prototype of the smartphone application, and a very basic website. Although the original
      pitch for the project gave equal importance to both the website and app, we have decided that it will be more efficient to create a detailed prototype of one of these instead
      of spreading our limited resources thin. It is important to us that we create a detailed prototype that could be shown to someone outside of the project who would be able to
      understand its functionality immediately. Whilst the visual design is important on some level, our aim for this prototype is to prioritize functionality over slick visuals; with
      some imagery, a logo, and a consistent colour pallet being established early-on which will provide us with an excellent point to begin building the functionality from.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">The most critical goal of this prototype is ensuring that we represent all of the basic functionality that will exist in the full application at a later
      date. This will consist of lists of different potential toxins, categories for those lists, a representation of Maps implementation, a ‘report a toxin’ screen, and a page with a
      list of veterinary clinics. If the app can implement all of this functionality in an intuitive manner, then we will have succeeded at our core goal. If we had no time left and had
      to choose, this goal would be the one we would strive to achieve.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Another important goal will be establishing a consistent format for the toxin report pages. These pages will contain information that the user can read on
      potential toxins, and will likely answer questions such as ‘What do I do if my cat has consumed X?’ and ‘What are the symptoms of X poisoning?’. Establishing a consistent format
      for the questions and answers will go a long way for readability, and employing some basic images of the potential toxins on the pages will help with the overall design. For this
      prototype, our goal is to create a complete question and answer page for 10 different toxins/non-toxins to clearly establish that the format we have chosen will work on a larger
      scale.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Establishing the visual style is an important part of the project at the beginning. We want to quickly find a colour scheme to roll with, along with a logo,
      UI and font. These will go a long way to make our prototype feel ready for further development and will hopefully provide the illusion that it is a real app at a glance. This
      should be an achievable goal because it is an early step, and it is unlikely it will be cut.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Our final goal is to create the skeleton of the Feline Friendly website. This is far less important than the app, as we have decided to put most of our
      focus in creating a solid single prototype rather than two different ones. The goal of the website is to show off the basic visual scheme and UI. If the website must be scaled
      back, it shouldn’t influence our ability to achieve our main aim for this project and is therefore our least important goal.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Plans and Progress</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">The idea for the Feline Friendly mobile app was conceived by Michelle. When Michelle became the owner of her first cat, she aimed to do everything
      possible to keep her cat safe. One morning, Michelle found her cat in the kitchen with an excessive amount of drool coming from her mouth. Michelle was eventually able to
      deduce her cat had gotten fly spray on her fur while sitting on the kitchen windowsill with an automatic fly sprayer. Her cat had then proceeded to lick her fur and get the
      fly spray in her mouth. Michelle was immediately concerned that this could make her cat unwell and attempted to research whether fly spray was bad for cats to ingest. Michelle
      had a difficult time finding any specific information that helped her to know how to assist her cat.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">When considering what to choose for her project idea during assignment 1, Michelle thought back to this time and thought it would be useful to
      create a mobile app that contained all the information that would help a cat owner who thinks their pet may have been poisoned. Once we began collaborating as a group,
      we decided to progress with this project as we felt it provided us with a substantial amount of design choices and a variety of different development directions we could
      pursue.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">The initial plan was to build a web-based service with a companion mobile application. The website would host the majority of the content for the
      service, including searching for toxins information; finding toxins that have been reported in suburbs; finding a veterinary clinic; and searching for pet poison hotlines.
      The companion mobile app was to provide users with the ability to scan an image of an unfamiliar plant and use the app to identify it and gain information on it relevant to
      cats, and to allow the user to report toxins they identify within their suburb.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Once we began working on the project, we realised we would not be able to make a significant amount of progress working on both a website and a mobile
      app at the same time. Lachlan had begun working on the basic structure of the website and information database; however, we decided it would be better to focus on building an
      interactive user interface for a mobile app that contained the services that both the website and companion mobile application would have offered. We have left the website
      content viewable via this website, in the navigation bar above labelled ‘app’, to allow for further development to be pursued at a later time.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Our team selected the online prototyping website, Figma, to design our prototype in. We began by creating a low-fidelity wireframe layout of how
      each section of the app would appear. The full set of wireframes can be viewed</p>
    <div class="prototypeImgs">
      <img class="screenshotSize" src="wireFrame1.png" alt="A sample of Feline Friendly wireframes">
      <img class="screenshotSize" src="wireFrame2.png" alt="A sample of Feline Friendly wireframes">
      <img class="screenshotSize" src="wireFrame3.jpg" alt="A sample of Feline Friendly wireframes">
    </div>
    <p class="imageCaptions"><b>Wireframe samples</b></p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">It was during this time that we confirmed which services we would focus on providing in our initial prototype. Our main focus has been centred on
      providing information on toxins for users to access. The user will have the ability to search for toxins by either entering their search terms into a search bar or by
      browsing through information supplied to them, separated into four distinct categories; foods, medications, plants, and house-hold products. Due to the nature of Figma,
      we were unable to produce a functional search bar within the prototype; however, a search bar was designed and placed in this section to display its appearance and
      indicate the role it would play in a fully functional app. Functionality was added to the four browsable toxin categories. The user is able to select any one of these,
      such as ‘food’, scroll through the list of toxins, and select one of the items. When the user selects one of the items, they will be shown information on what will happen
      if their cat has ingested the toxin; what to do if they have consumed the toxin; and how to prevent poisoning from the toxin. Not every toxin listed has corresponding
      information attached to it; however, a large list of items is displayed to indicate what the app will look like once it has a larger database of information behind it.</p>
    <div class="prototypeImgs">
      <img class="screenshotSize" src="searchToxins.png" alt="Search toxins screen">
      <img class="screenshotSize" src="foods.png" alt="Food toxin list">
      <img class="screenshotSize" src="milk.png" alt="Sample food information">
    </div>
    <p class="imageCaptions"><b>Toxins search screens</b></p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">The remaining sections of the app were designed but have limited functionality due to the limitations of what can be achieved in Figma. Each page
      has some level of interactivity to give the user an idea of what they can do in the app and what kind of pathways they will take when making selections. Specific examples
      of this are the ‘find toxins near me’ and ‘find a veterinary clinic’ sections. Both of these sections require either location services to view maps or user input of their
      postcode. If the user selects to view toxins via a map, they will be shown a placeholder image of a generic Melbourne suburb; however, the map will have no interactivity.
      This will give an idea of what this screen will look like in the final product. Similar to the search bar in the toxins section, the user will not be able to input their
      postcode; however, a placeholder postcode and suburbs have been entered to show how this task will be performed.</p>
    <div class="prototypeImgs">
      <img class="screenshotSize" src="postcode.png" alt="Example of postcode input">
      <img class="screenshotSize" src="map.png" alt="Example of map">
    </div>
    <p class="imageCaptions"><b>Postcode and map screens</b></p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">When a user enters their postcode and selects their suburb from the list, which will be developed into a drop-down list in the completed version of
      the app, they will be shown either a list of sample toxins found in the area or a sample list of veterinary clinics within the placeholder postcode; depending on the selection they made. Once again, this was done
      to display what the final version of these screens will look like and limited interactivity has been applied to show the pathing the user will take when certain selections
      are made.</p>
    <div class="prototypeImgs">

    </div>
    <p class="imageCaptions"><b>'Toxins near me' and 'Veterinary clinics near me' screens</b></p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">The ‘contact a poison hotline’ section of the app is possibly the section which is the closest to how it will look and function in a completed
      version of the app. If the user selects this option, they will be displayed with a list of pet poison hotlines for a number of different countries. There are most likely
      many more hotlines available than the few we have initially included; however, we selected the main hotlines available in larger English speaking countries as these will
      likely be the initial users of the app.</p>

      <img class="screenshotSize" src="poisonHotline.png" alt="Poison hotline list">
    </div>
    <p class="imageCaptions"><b>Poison hotline screen</b></p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">The ‘report a toxin’ section of the app is possibly the section which has the least amount of functionality applied to it due to Figma limitations.
      A basic user interface was designed to show how this section will be laid out and a simple pop-up message was created as an overlay to demonstrate what would happen when a
      user clicks the ‘submit’ button. In a more fully-functional version of the app, the user will be able to enter the toxin details and submit those to us for review and to be
      added to the database.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="imageCaptions"><b>Report a toxin screens</b></p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">After multiple attempts to design the plant identification section of the app, it was decided not to include it in this adaptation of the app.
      This decision was made as it was difficult to convey how this section would look and how the user would be able to interact with it due to Figma limitations. In future
      adaptations of the app, it would be easier to design and incorporate this functionality when there is the capacity to access mobile cameras and link to plant.id software.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">When the app is opened by the user, they are shown the Feline Friendly logo and loading circle to indicate to them the app is in the process of
      loading. Due to Figma limitations, there is no ability to progress automatically from the loading screen to the landing page of the app and the user must click on the screen
      to move forward. In a fully functional version of the app, this would obviously be designed to occur automatically.</p>
    <div class="prototypeImgs">
      <img class="screenshotSize" src="loadingPage.png" alt="Report a toxin screen">
    </div>
    <p class="imageCaptions"><b>Loading screen</b></p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">In terms of app navigation, a sidebar menu was incorporated due to the large number of functions the app offers. The menu is accessible from every
      section of the app to allow the user to move to their selected section from anywhere in the app. Interactivity has been built into the menu with Figma. The user can also use
      the triangle icon present in the Android navigation bar to return to previous sections of the app.</p>
    <div class="prototypeImgs">
      <img class="screenshotSize" src="sideBarMenu.png" alt="Report a toxin screen">
    </div>
    <p class="imageCaptions"><b>Sidebar menu</b></p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Looking forward to future development, further progress can be made by transitioning from Figma to a more comprehensive app design program, such as
      MIT App Inventor, with more effort being put towards the design of backend software for storage and databasing.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Roles</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Our group did not define any specific roles for each member. Each team member worked on elements that they felt best reflected their strengths and
      interests and what they would be able to contribute the most to. This seemed to be the most effective approach for our team. Michelle designed the user interface for the app,
      reflecting her interests in web design, and Lachlan designed backend software for the website, reflecting his interest in software development. Timothy completed research for
      cat toxin content and each team member worked on aspects of the written report content.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Scope and Limits</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Our initial plan for this project was to have an informative website with a companion app. Once we began development, it was decided that to do both
      would be difficult in the time we had available. For this reason, we decided to focus on delivering an informative and functional app prototype that incorporated all the
      elements we had initially outlined for the website and app. Due to the program used for prototyping, Figma, we had to limit how interactive certain elements could be. For
      example, when searching for toxins nearby; the user has the option to search via a map. Functional map technology was unable to be incorporated here; therefore a placeholder
      map of the searched postcode was added to indicate what the finished product will ultimately display. Similarly, when a user wishes to search for a toxin or a veterinary
      clinic within their area; they do so by entering their postcode. A functional postcode search was unable to be built with Figma so a placeholder postcode was entered to show
      how this function would work in the finished product.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Tools and Technologies</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Figma</b><br>Figma will be used for the development of both the low and high-fidelity prototypes of the Feline Friendly mobile application.
      Knowledge in this area will be supplied by Michelle who has prior experience using Figma to design user interface prototypes for mobile devices.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Canva</b><br>Canva will be used to design the Feline Friendly logo. Knowledge in this area will be supplied by Michelle who has prior experience
      using Canva for basic logo design.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>MIT App Inventor</b><br>MIT App Inventor will be used to further progress the app from a user interface prototype to a fully functioning mobile
      application. No team members have prior experience in the use of this program or any other app development programs.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Node.js server platform</b><br>Node.js server platform will be used to host the backend of the app service once the app is transitioned to a
      more fully functional product. Knowledge in this area will be supplied by Lachlan who has prior experience using this platform.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>MySQL database</b><br>MySQL database will be used to store all information to be delivered through the application once the app is transitioned
      to a more fully functional product. Knowledge in this area will be supplied by Lachlan who has prior experience in SQL database integration.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Plant.id</b><br>Plant.id service machine learning API will be used to allow users to identify and search for plants with the app once this service
      is functionally implemented. Knowledge in this area will be supplied by Lachlan who has prior experience in the integration of an external API.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Testing</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">For our project, we created a Figma prototype for the application, and a very basic website. The website is intentionally simple as it is not the primary
      focus for this prototyping phase. We will pour most of the effort into the app. Because of this, we predict the website will require very little testing other than making sure
      it is visually sound. For the Figma prototype, it is much more important that each of the elements are linked correctly. Despite the intentionally small-scale of the prototype,
      the number of buttons that have to be tested and links between components that need to be established will be large, so there will likely be a few errors along the way.
      No external testing will be required, as having multiple eyes going over the project every day will likely be enough to catch all of the bugs; which will most likely be
      incorrect links between components or the occasional typo. We are confident that we will be able to create a solid Figma prototype that will represent our vision without
      the requirement of external user testing.</p>

    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Risks</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Prototyping program</b><br>Figma is the program which has been selected to build the wireframes and prototype of the Feline Friendly application.
      While Figma appears to be one of the best, freely available prototyping websites available; it is limited in the number of tutorials it offers for users to learn how to use the system. This could lead to
      challenges during the development process if we are unable to work out how to correctly use Figma to design our application. Time could be wasted trying to learn one system
      which turns out to be too difficult to be used; resulting in us needing to find and learn an alternate prototyping system, leading to more time lost.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Compatibility</b><br>As each group member will be required to collaborate on the same file within Figma, there is potential for
      compatibility issues to occur if Figma is not supported on the device or system a member is using. The Figma website states Figma performs best on desktop systems.
      Team members using mobile or tablet devices may have issues completing development with Figma. If this occurs, delays will be experienced as there will be fewer members
      working on the project or an alternate prototyping program will need to be found and learnt.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Figma limitations</b><br>Figma is limited in the amount of development that can be done with it. It gives the ability to design a user interface
      with functioning pathways; however, there is minimal interactivity that can be incorporated into the prototype, e.g., an image of a map can be included but a functional
      map cannot be included. This places limitations on how far we can take the design of the application and may result in a prototype that is not as effective at displaying
      use and functions as other possible prototype design systems may be.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Transitioning</b><br>Another risk involved with the use of Figma is the ability to transition to another system for the building of the final product.
      Looking forward to further development, it is likely MIT App Inventor would be used to develop the application. It is possible that transition issues will occur when moving
      from one design system to another. It is possible the prototype we design in Figma may not smoothly transition across to a functional application when designed in MIT App
      Inventor. If this occurred, there would be a delay in the design process and re-design would need to reoccur or another program would need to be sourced for development.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Sourcing information</b><br>There is no specific resource available that can be referenced to gain accurate information on cat toxins. Sourcing
      accurate information will take time as the information will likely need to be gained from a variety of different sources. A risk associated with this is conflicts between
      sources. There could be differing opinions and information expressed from different sources in relation to items which may or may not be toxic to cats. As a group of people
      with limited prior knowledge relating to cat toxins, it would be highly important that we carefully research the information we gather to avoid supplying incorrect information
      in our product.</p>
