    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Feline Friendly user interface prototype</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><a class="prototypeLink" href="https://bit.ly/3lYeWgU">https://bit.ly/3lYeWgU</a></p>
    <h2 class="containerSubHeadings">overview</h2>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Topic</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Feline Friendly is a web-based service with a companion mobile app for Android that aims to provide information and education to cat owners
      regarding items which are toxic to cats. Feline Friendly will enable users to identify and access information on a variety of foods, plants, household products,
      and medications. The user will be provided with evidence-based information on whether they are dangerous to cats and what they should do if they believe their cat
      has come into contact with the toxin. The service will allow users to find details of veterinary clinics within their area and contact details of pet poison hotlines
      they can contact in the event they believe their cat has been poisoned.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"> As an outcome of this project, cat owners would have an educational resource readily available to them which contains all the information
      necessary for them to identify and react to a poisoning event; without having to access multiple different resources to get the information they require. We hope the
      creation of this project will assist in reducing the likelihood of cat poisonings occurring and prevent deaths with the inclusion of veterinary and hotline contact details.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Motivation</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">As discussed by DeClementi (2014), one of the best ways to prevent pet poisoning is through the provision of poison prevention information.
      Currently, there are very few resources available to cat owners that include information on toxins, what to do if their cat is poisoned, and where they can go for help.
      Feline Friendly wants to provide cat owners with a comprehensive resource they can refer to for all the information they need regarding toxins, enabling them to recognise and respond quickly to poisoning events. Through the use of plant
      identification technology, the current trends of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning will be incorporated into this project for users to be able to identify unknown plants their cat has consumed through photography. Working on this
      project will show our ability to remotely collaborate on a project; capability to learn and apply unfamiliar IT technologies quickly; and ability to take a project from an idea through
      to design and prototyping.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Landscape</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">There are similar services currently available, such as the Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) website and mobile application; created by American
      Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) (2014). APCC provides detailed information to users which covers plants, medications, foods, and household hazards;
      however, it is an American based service and the poison hotline numbers it provides are relevant for American residents only. ‘Plants for Cats’, created by Delattre
      Consulting (2020) is another alternate mobile application currently available through the Google Play store. ‘Plants for Cats’ provides poison hotline numbers for multiple
      countries; however, its content is limited to just plant information. Feline Friendly will bridge the gap between existing products by creating a service that provides
      all of these features within one product.</p>
    <h2 class="containerSubHeadings">description</h2>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Aims</h3>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Plans and Progress</h3>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Roles</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Our group did not define any specific roles for each member. Each team member worked on elements that they felt best reflected their strengths and
      interests and what they would be able to contribute the most to. This seemed to be the most effective approach for our team. Michelle designed the user interface for the app,
      reflecting her interests in web design, and Lachlan designed backend software for the website, reflecting his interest in software development. Timothy completed research for
      cat toxin content and each team member worked on aspects of the written report content.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Scope and Limits</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Our initial plan for this project was to have an informative website with a companion app. Once we began development, it was decided that to do both
      would be difficult in the time we had available. For this reason, we decided to focus on delivering an informative and functional app prototype that incorporated all the
      elements we had initially outlined for the website and app. Due to the program used for prototyping, Figma, we had to limit how interactive certain elements could be. For
      example, when searching for toxins nearby; the user has the option to search via a map. Functional map technology was unable to be incorporated here; therefore a placeholder
      map of the searched postcode was added to indicate what the finished product will ultimately display. Similarly, when a user wishes to search for a toxin or a veterinary
      clinic within their area; they do so by entering their postcode. A functional postcode search was unable to be built with Figma so a placeholder postcode was entered to show
      how this function would work in the finished product.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Tools and Technologies</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Figma</b><br>Figma will be used for the development of both the low and high-fidelity prototypes of the Feline Friendly mobile application.
      Knowledge in this area will be supplied by Michelle who has prior experience using Figma to design user interface prototypes for mobile devices.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>MIT App Inventor</b><br>MIT App Inventor will be used to further progress the app from a user interface prototype to a fully functioning mobile
      application. No team members have prior experience in the use of this program or any other app development programs.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Node.js server platform</b><br>Node.js server platform will be used to host the backend of the app service once the app is transitioned to a
      more fully functional product. Knowledge in this area will be supplied by Lachlan who has prior experience using this platform.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>MySQL database</b><br>MySQL database will be used to store all information to be delivered through the application once the app is transitioned
      to a more fully functional product. Knowledge in this area will be supplied by Lachlan who has prior experience in SQL database integration.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Plant.id</b><br>Plant.id service machine learning API will be used to allow users to identify and search for plants with the app once this service
      is functionally implemented. Knowledge in this area will be supplied by Lachlan who has prior experience in the integration of an external API.</p>

    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Risks</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Prototyping program</b><br>Figma is the program which has been selected to build the wireframes and prototype of the Feline Friendly application.
      While Figma appears to be one of the best, freely available prototyping websites available; it is limited in the number of tutorials it offers for users to learn how to use the system. This could lead to
      challenges during the development process if we are unable to work out how to correctly use Figma to design our application. Time could be wasted trying to learn one system
      which turns out to be too difficult to be used; resulting in us needing to find and learn an alternate prototyping system, leading to more time lost.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Compatibility</b><br>As each group member will be required to collaborate on the same file within Figma, there is potential for
      compatibility issues to occur if Figma is not supported on the device or system a member is using. The Figma website states Figma performs best on desktop systems.
      Team members using mobile or tablet devices may have issues completing development with Figma. If this occurs, delays will be experienced as there will be fewer members
      working on the project or an alternate prototyping program will need to be found and learnt.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Figma limitations</b><br>Figma is limited in the amount of development that can be done with it. It gives the ability to design a user interface
      with functioning pathways; however, there is minimal interactivity that can be incorporated into the prototype, e.g., an image of a map can be included but a functional
      map cannot be included. This places limitations on how far we can take the design of the application and may result in a prototype that is not as effective at displaying
      use and functions as other possible prototype design systems may be.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Transitioning</b><br>Another risk involved with the use of Figma is the ability to transition to another system for the building of the final product.
      Looking forward to further development, it is likely MIT App Inventor would be used to develop the application. It is possible that transition issues will occur when moving
      from one design system to another. It is possible the prototype we design in Figma may not smoothly transition across to a functional application when designed in MIT App
      Inventor. If this occurred, there would be a delay in the design process and re-design would need to reoccur or another program would need to be sourced for development.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"><b>Sourcing information</b><br>There is no specific resource available that can be referenced to gain accurate information on cat toxins. Sourcing
      accurate information will take time as the information will likely need to be gained from a variety of different sources. A risk associated with this is conflicts between
      sources. There could be differing opinions and information expressed from different sources in relation to items which may or may not be toxic to cats. As a group of people
      with limited prior knowledge relating to cat toxins, it would be highly important that we carefully research the information we gather to avoid supplying incorrect information
      in our product.</p>
