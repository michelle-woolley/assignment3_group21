    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Feline Friendly user interface prototype</h3>

    <h2 class="containerSubHeadings">overview</h2>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Topic</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Feline Friendly is a web-based service with a companion mobile app for Android that aims to provide information and education to cat owners
      regarding items which are toxic to cats. Feline Friendly will enable users to identify and access information on a variety of foods, plants, household products,
      and medications. The user will be provided with evidence-based information on whether they are dangerous to cats and what they should do if they believe their cat
      has come into contact with the toxin. The service will allow users to find details of veterinary clinics within their area and contact details of pet poison hotlines
      they can contact in the event they believe their cat has been poisoned.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo"> As an outcome of this project, cat owners would have an educational resource readily available to them which contains all the information
      necessary for them to identify and react to a poisoning event; without having to access multiple different resources to get the information they require. We hope the
      creation of this project will assist in reducing the likelihood of cat poisonings occurring and prevent deaths with the inclusion of veterinary and hotline contact details.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Motivation</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">As discussed by DeClementi (2014), one of the best ways to prevent pet poisoning is through the provision of poison prevention information.
      Currently, there are very few resources available to cat owners that include information on toxins, what to do if their cat is poisoned, and where they can go for help.
      Feline Friendly wants to provide cat owners with a comprehensive resource they can refer to for all the information they need regarding toxins, enabling them to recognise and respond quickly to poisoning events. Through the use of plant
      identification technology, the current trends of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning will be incorporated into this project for users to be able to identify unknown plants their cat has consumed through photography. Working on this
      project will show our ability to remotely collaborate on a project; capability to learn and apply unfamiliar IT technologies quickly; and ability to take a project from an idea through
      to design and prototyping.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Landscape</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">There are similar services currently available, such as the Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) website and mobile application; created by American
      Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) (2014). APCC provides detailed information to users which covers plants, medications, foods, and household hazards;
      however, it is an American based service and the poison hotline numbers it provides are relevant for American residents only. ‘Plants for Cats’, created by Delattre
      Consulting (2020) is another alternate mobile application currently available through the Google Play store. ‘Plants for Cats’ provides poison hotline numbers for multiple
      countries; however, its content is limited to just plant information. Feline Friendly will bridge the gap between existing products by creating a service that provides
      all of these features within one product.</p>

    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Aims</h3>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Plans and Progress</h3>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Roles</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Our group did not define any specific roles for each member. Each team member worked on elements that they felt best reflected their strengths and
      interests and what they would be able to contribute the most to. This seemed to be the most effective approach for our team. Michelle designed the user interface for the app,
      reflecting her interests in web design, and Lachlan designed backend software for the website, reflecting his interest in software development. Timothy completed research for
      cat toxin content and each team member worked on aspects of the written report content.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Scope and Limits</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Our initial plan for this project was to have an informative website with a companion app. Once we began development, it was decided that to do both
      would be difficult in the time we had available. For this reason, we decided to focus on delivering an informative and functional app prototype that incorporated all the
      elements we had initially outlined for the website and app. Due to the program used for prototyping, Figma, we had to limit how interactive certain elements could be. For
      example, when searching for toxins nearby; the user has the option to search via a map. Functional map technology was unable to be incorporated here; therefore a placeholder
      map of the searched postcode was added to indicate what the finished product will ultimately display. Similarly, when a user wishes to search for a toxin or a veterinary
      clinic within their area; they do so by entering their postcode. A functional postcode search was unable to be built with Figma so a placeholder postcode was entered to show
      how this function would work in the finished product.</p>
