    <p class="techReportInfo">This assignment followed suit with our previous group assignment, there was a somewhat lack of communication at parts of the process and this led
      to unnecessary stress on the group. I do feel however that despite this, this group has shown its effectiveness and tenacity to complete the work required at a high
      standard. I believe that unforeseen circumstances in my family life got in the way of my assignment completion which made it difficult for me and therefore us to communicate
      in an effective manner however in the end we came together and, like the previous assessment, created writing that surpassed our expectations.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">I learnt more about working effectively in a group under time constraints and differing opinions as well as how something as simple as an idea can
      transform into an application proposition of such high caliber. In the future I think it would be wise to inform group members in a more authoritarian way that communication
      is imperative and we must keep on our time schedule if we are to be effective.</p>

    <p class="techReportInfo">Assignment 3 was an interesting assignment as it utilised many more programs and out sourced other ways to interact. The use of paddle was useful in
      the aspect to consolidate ideas in an interactive format. The use of paddle in this assignment was to create an app for our project idea. The things that went well was the
      way our group worked together to get this done. As always there is always room for improvement, in the way we interact as a team and also the way we utilise tools that are
      available to us. Through working with the group 21, I have learnt that we all have our different strengths, and we can work together to produce what is necessary for the job
      on hand. Surprising factors were the way the group came together to produce what was needed. As listed earlier, we as a group have our own strengths and we can work alongside
      each other with open communication to get the job done. I believe that our team has produced quality information of the task that has been given to us and we have utilised
      the tools that are available to us to present the criteria for the assignment 3.</p>

    <p class="techReportInfo">As this assignment wraps up, I feel both a burden lift off of me and a welcome sense of accomplishment. I believe we have created an interesting
      product pitch with plenty of potential and despite many difficult roadblocks and communication issues along the way, we managed to complete every component to what I believe
      is to a high standard. I was pleasantly surprised over the quality of our app prototype! Part of me was sceptical about Figma before I started using it, but in the end I
      found that it worked excellently.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">If I were to be given the chance to redo this assignment from the beginning. I would ensure far better planning for the times we have our meetings.
      I would focus on having shorter but more frequent meetings to give each group member multiple opportunities to be up-to-date even if they miss a few. I would also encourage
      each group member to share their phone number as a backup method of contact in case they are away for an extended period of time. Despite the best intentions of each group
      member, I have learned that it is difficult to coordinate as a team without a distinct leader which we did not establish, and in any future group setting I would establish
      a team leader to keep us on track.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Michelle</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Similarly to how we performed together as a team during the last assignment, I believe we managed to collaborate well and successfully create the
      beginnings of a project that has a lot of promise; overcoming a number of issues along the way to be able to meet the submission deadline.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">The biggest issues experienced by us as a team during this assignment were communication breakdown and time management problems. We fell into a similar
      trap that we encountered during our first assignment together and started working on content too late. This coupled with a lack of communication lead to a lot of last-minute
      scrambling to get everything finished on time. We would have benefitted from scheduling more frequent team meetings to discuss progress.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">One thing that I have found surprising during this assignment is how every team member came together to turn my small idea for a cat toxin information
      app into a product that offers so much more than that. This, in turn, leads to what I have learned about working as part of a group; which is that many minds working together
      can take a small and basic idea and turn it into a product with a lot of potential.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Group</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">As a group, we feel that we collaborated reasonably well as a team despite facing a number of difficulties along the way. Similarly to our last assignment,
      we all acknowledge that we should have commenced work on the content much sooner than what we did. Despite this, we managed to come together in the final weeks to produce an
      assignment of a high quality that we are all happy with.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">We followed a similar format for allocation of work that we did throughout assignment 2 with members completing sections based on interests and skill sets.
      Michelle designed the user interface prototype of the project with Timothy contributing the bulk of the information displayed in the prototype. Michelle, Timothy, Jorin, and Zorren
      worked together to complete the written content of the report. Lachlan created the basic outline of the website for the project. Luke was in a unique situation, currently being
      away on deployment with the army, and was therefore unable to contribute to this assignment.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">There are a number of things we recognise as a group that we could have done better to help us avoid a lot of last minute stress to get everything completed
      on time. The main things we acknowledge we need to improve on are communication and time management. The lack of communication lead to delays in making progress on written elements
      of the project and the presentation. If there had been no extension to the submission date, we would not have met the deadline. In addition, better management of our time would have
      also prevented the occurrence of progress delays.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">As a team, we were surprised at our ability to come together to work on a project and take it from being a small idea and begin turning it into a reality.
      While we were not able to make as much progress on it as we would have liked to; we are proud of the artifacts we managed to produce.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Reflecting on what we have learnt about working in a team, we all agree that effective communication is the key to success. Earlier and more regular team
      meetings and frequent communication would have led to us making more consistent progress as a group.</p>
