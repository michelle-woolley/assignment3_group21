    <p class="techReportInfo">As this assignment wraps up, I feel both a burden lift off of me and a welcome sense of accomplishment. I believe we have created an interesting
      product pitch with plenty of potential and despite many difficult roadblocks and communication issues along the way, we managed to complete every component to what I believe
      is to a high standard. I was pleasantly surprised over the quality of our app prototype! Part of me was sceptical about Figma before I started using it, but in the end I
      found that it worked excellently.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">If I were to be given the chance to redo this assignment from the beginning. I would ensure far better planning for the times we have our meetings.
      I would focus on having shorter but more frequent meetings to give each group member multiple opportunities to be up-to-date even if they miss a few. I would also encourage
      each group member to share their phone number as a backup method of contact in case they are away for an extended period of time. Despite the best intentions of each group
      member, I have learned that it is difficult to coordinate as a team without a distinct leader which we did not establish, and in any future group setting I would establish
      a team leader to keep us on track.</p>

    <p class="techReportInfo">Similarly to how we performed together as a team during the last assignment, I believe we managed to collaborate well and successfully create the
      beginnings of a project that has a lot of promise; overcoming a number of issues along the way to be able to meet the submission deadline.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">The biggest issues experienced by us as a team during this assignment were communication breakdown and time management problems. We fell into a similar
      trap that we encountered during our first assignment together and started working on content too late. This coupled with a lack of communication lead to a lot of last-minute
      scrambling to get everything finished on time. We would have benefitted from scheduling more frequent team meetings to discuss progress.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">One thing that I have found surprising during this assignment is how every team member came together to turn my small idea for a cat toxin information
      app into a product that offers so much more than that. This, in turn, leads to what I have learned about working as part of a group; which is that many minds working together
      can take a small and basic idea and turn it into a product with a lot of potential.</p>
